A flexible way to handle safe area, also works on Android and Web!

## Getting started

Install the library using either Yarn:

```
yarn add react-native-safe-area-context
```

or npm:

```
npm install --save react-native-safe-area-context
```

You then need to link the native parts of the library for the platforms you are using. 

#### Linking in React Native >= 0.60

Linking the package is not required anymore with [Autolinking](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/blob/master/docs/autolinking.md).

- **iOS Platform:**

  `$ npx pod-install`

#### Linking in React Native < 0.60

The easiest way to link the library is using the CLI tool by running this command from the root of your project:

```
react-native link react-native-safe-area-context
```

If you can't or don't want to use the CLI tool, you can also manually link the library using the instructions below (click on the arrow to show them):

<summary>Manually link the library on iOS</summary>

Either follow the [instructions in the React Native documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/linking-libraries-ios#manual-linking) to manually link the framework or link using [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org) by adding this to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'react-native-safe-area-context', :path => '../node_modules/react-native-safe-area-context'
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Manually link the library on Android</summary>

Make the following changes:

#### `android/settings.gradle`

```groovy
include ':react-native-safe-area-context'
project(':react-native-safe-area-context').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/react-native-safe-area-context/android')
```

#### `android/app/build.gradle`

```groovy
dependencies {
   ...
   implementation project(':react-native-safe-area-context')
}
```

#### `android/app/src/main/.../MainApplication.java`

On top, where imports are:

```java
import com.th3rdwave.safeareacontext.SafeAreaContextPackage;
```

Add the `SafeAreaContextPackage` class to your list of exported packages.

```java
@Override
protected List<ReactPackage> getPackages() {
    return Arrays.asList(
            new MainReactPackage(),
            ...
            new SafeAreaContextPackage()
    );
}
```

</details>

## Usage

`SafeAreaView` is a regular `View` component with the safe area edges applied as padding.

If you set your own padding on the view, it will be added to the padding from the safe area.

**If you are targeting web, you must set up `SafeAreaProvider` in as described in the hooks section**. You do not need to for native platforms.

```js
import { SafeAreaView } from 'react-native-safe-area-context';

function SomeComponent() {
  return (
    <SafeAreaView>
      <View />
    </SafeAreaView>
  );
}
```

### Props

All props are optional.

#### `emulateUnlessSupported`

`true` (default) or `false`

On iOS 10, emulate the safe area using the status bar height and home indicator sizes.

#### `edges`

Array of `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left`. Defaults to all.

Sets the edges to apply the safe area insets to.

## Hooks

Hooks give you direct access to the safe area insets. This is a more advanced use-case, and might perform worse than `SafeAreaView` when rotating the device.

First, add `SafeAreaProvider` in your app root component. You may need to add it in other places too, including at the root of any modals any any routes when using `react-native-screen`.

```js
import { SafeAreaProvider } from 'react-native-safe-area-context';

function App() {
  return <SafeAreaProvider>...</SafeAreaProvider>;
}
```

You use the `useSafeAreaInsets` hook to get the insets in the form of `{ top: number, right: number, bottom: number: number, left: number }`.

```js
import { useSafeAreaInsets } from 'react-native-safe-area-context';

function HookComponent() {
  const insets = useSafeAreaInsets();

  return <View style={{ paddingTop: insets.top }} />;
}
```

Usage with consumer api:

```js
import { SafeAreaInsetsContext } from 'react-native-safe-area-context';

class ClassComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <SafeAreaInsetsContext.Consumer>
        {(insets) => <View style={{ paddingTop: insets.top }} />}
      </SafeAreaInsetsContext.Consumer>
    );
  }
}
```

## Web SSR

If you are doing server side rendering on the web you can use `initialMetrics` to inject insets and frame value based on the device the user has, or simply pass zero values. Since insets measurement is async it will break rendering your page content otherwise.

## Optimization

If you can, use `SafeAreaView`. It's implemented natively so when rotating the device, there is no delay from the asynchronous bridge.

To speed up the initial render, you can import `initialWindowMetrics` from this package and set as the `initialMetrics` prop on the provider as described in Web SSR. You cannot do this if your provider remounts, or you are using `react-native-navigation`.

```js
import {
  SafeAreaProvider,
  initialWindowMetrics,
} from 'react-native-safe-area-context';

function App() {
  return (
    <SafeAreaProvider initialMetrics={initialWindowMetrics}>
      ...
    </SafeAreaProvider>
  );
}
```
